## About RECENT

**Tagline:** Where local meets international.

RECENT is a creative hub designed to host and promote a variety of video content, starting with our first upcoming series, "The Chronicles of Love." Our goal is to provide a clean, professional, and cinematic viewing experience for our audience.

## The Platform

This website serves as the central "menu" for all our shows. It is built with simple, clean HTML and CSS, and it is hosted using GitHub Pages. The site directs viewers to unlisted YouTube videos, allowing us to maintain a branded experience while leveraging powerful, free video hosting.

## Monetization Strategy

Our primary monetization method is through our official [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/RecordedEntertainment). We offer fans early access to episodes and exclusive behind-the-scenes content as a reward for their direct support, which funds the creation of our shows.
